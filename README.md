## CodeGPT

CodeGPT can generate code snippets, complete blocks of code, or even entire programs from scratch. Simply provide it with a natural language description of what you want to achieve, and CodeGPT will generate the corresponding code.

The app runs like a **conversational app**, where you can interact with the model by providing it with natural language instructions. The model will then generate code snippets, complete blocks of code, or even entire programs based on your instructions. The app also shows a chat history and chat actions, so that you can track your conversation with the model and see what code it has generated.

You can ask the model to generate an entire program, such as a simple game or a web server.

You can ask the model to generate a code snippet to perform a specific task, such as sorting a list or finding the average of a set of numbers.
